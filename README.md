# Google Summer of Code Projects

See the [issues list](https://github.com/purescript/gsoc/issues).


- Students, Mentors: If you're interested in a project, please add a comment to the relevant issue.
- Please try to keep the comment noise to a minimum. Use \#purescript IRC for asking questions, and I will clarify things here as necessary.
- If you'd like to propose a project, please ask on IRC first, and we'll review it.
